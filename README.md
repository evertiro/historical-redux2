# Redux Options Framework v1.0.0 #

Wordpress options framework which uses the [WordPress Settings API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API "WordPress Settings API"), Custom Error/Validation Handling, Custom Field/Validation Types, and import/export functionality.

## Donate to the Framework ##

I develop Redux (and my other projects) because I enjoy them, and almost exclusively release them to the community as open source projects. If you can, please donate to help support the ongoing development of Redux Framework!

## Simple Usage ##

Download Redux [here](https://github.com/ghost1227/Redux-Framework/archive/stable.zip) and unzip it in your theme. Rename the Redux directory to `admin/`.

```bash
$ cd my-theme
$ unzip ~/Downloads/Redux-Framework-master.zip -d admin
```

Alternatively clone the repository using git:

```bash
$ cd my-theme
$ git clone git://github.com/ghost1227/Redux-Framework/ admin
```

Or use:

```bash
$ cd my-theme
$ git submodule add git://github.com/ghost1227/Redux-Framework/ admin
```

Next, copy `admin/theme-settings.php` to the base of your theme directory, so it won't get overwritten when you update Redux.

Include the `theme-settings.php` file for use in your theme by adding this to your `functions.php`:

```php
get_template_part('theme', 'settings');
```

Finally change the settings as needed in `theme-settings.php`. The file is heavily documented, the rest of the [documention][docs] is a work in progress.
